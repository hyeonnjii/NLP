### NLP Project

This is the final project of the lecture "문화컨텐츠와자연어처리" in SKKU.
</br>
The project name is "Emotion Suggestion Service" which classifies and informs emotion keywords from the answers related to their feelings.
</br>
</br>
- Users can organize thier feelings by writing down their own situations and feelings so that they can check their feelings from the service.
- The program allows the users to choose by presenting more detailed emotion keywords based on the user's answers.
- Based on the chosen emotions, the service offers advice or solutions to them.
- * However, this code is limited for the process of presenting the emotion keywords in detail in this service.
